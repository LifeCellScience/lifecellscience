We will introduce some of the basic notation and ideas to be used in studying triangles. Our main result will be to show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180<sup>o<sup>.

The word “Trigonometry” is derived from the Greek roots.

_Tri / gono / metry_: Three / angle / measurement- the study of measuring triangles.

It is an analytical study of a three angled geometric figures namely the triangle.

The study of trigonometry is of great importance in several fields, for example in surveying, Astronomy, Navigation, and Engineering. In recent times, trigonometry is widely applied in many branches of science and engineering such as seismology, the design of electrical circuits, estimating the heights of tides in the ocean etc.

The measure of an angle will be revised. Sexagesimal, Centesimal and radian (Circular) measure and their relationships will be taken up. The three fundamental trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent of an angle and their reciprocals shall be introduced. The behavior of these functions (ratios) as the measure of an angle changes from 0o to 90o and the signs of trigonometric functions in different quadrants will also be dealt with.

## Define Ratios in a Right angle triangle

Consider a right angle triangle ABC having a right angle at B as shown in the following figure. Then, trigonometric ratios of the angle A in right angle triangle ABC are defined as follows

$%
sin of \angle A = \frac {Length of the sie opposite to angle A} {Length of the hypotaneous}
sin of \angle A = {BC}{AC}
$$
